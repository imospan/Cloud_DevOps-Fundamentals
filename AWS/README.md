Task AWS
===========

I've successfully completed [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials](https://training.epam.ua/Training/Details/3509) training and I've got [AWS Cloud Practitioner certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/0353baf1-20a6-40f2-9f5b-f254d6f03982/public_url).\
I also have experience working with various AWS services via console, AWS CLI and IaC (some examples can be found [here](https://github.com/imospan/devops_basecamp/tree/main/task5_ansible) and [here](https://github.com/imospan/devops_basecamp/tree/main/task6_terraform)).
Therefore, I don't consider it necessary to fill the repository with a bunch of screenshots and will just leave the main task here:

Task
